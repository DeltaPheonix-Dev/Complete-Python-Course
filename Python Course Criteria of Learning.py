#Course Outline:

#Module 1: Introduction to Python

#Getting Started with Python

#Getting started with Python is easy and straightforward. Here are the steps to help you begin your Python journey:#

#Step 1: Install Python
#- Visit the official Python website at python.org.
#- Go to the Downloads section and choose the appropriate Python version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
#- Download the installer and run it.
#- During the installation process, make sure to check the box that adds Python to the system PATH.

#Step 2: Choose a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
#- Python code is written in plain text files, so you'll need a text editor or an IDE to write and run your Python programs.
#- Some popular choices for text editors are Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Notepad++.
#- IDEs like PyCharm, Spyder, and IDLE provide more advanced features like code debugging and integrated terminal.

#Step 3: Write Your First Python Program
#- Open your chosen text editor or IDE.
#- Create a new file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello.py`.
#- Start by writing a simple "Hello, World!" program:
#```python
print("Hello, World!")
#```
#- Save the file.

#Step 4: Run Your Python Program
#- Open a command prompt or terminal.
#- Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python file using the `cd` command.
#- To run the Python program, type `python hello.py` (replace `hello.py` with the name of your Python file) and press Enter.
#- You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal.

#Step 5: Learn the Basics of Python Syntax
#- Python has a clean and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly.
#- Familiarize yourself with basic concepts like variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements (if-else, loops).
#- Experiment with simple programs to practice using these concepts.

#Step 6: Explore Python Documentation and Tutorials
#- The Python documentation (docs.python.org) is a valuable resource for learning Python. It provides a comprehensive guide to the language and its standard library.
#- There are numerous online tutorials, video courses, and interactive platforms (such as Codecademy, Coursera, and SoloLearn) available to learn Python. Choose a resource that suits your learning style.

#Step 7: Join Python Communities and Forums
#- Engage with the Python community to connect with fellow learners and experienced developers.
#- Participate in forums like the Python subreddit (reddit.com/r/Python) or the Python section of Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) to ask questions and seek help.

#Step 8: Practice, Experiment, and Build Projects
#- The best way to learn Python is through practice.
#- Work on small projects that interest you. It could be a simple calculator, a text-based game, or a web scraping script.
#- As you gain confidence, challenge yourself with more complex projects and explore different Python libraries and frameworks.

#Remember, learning Python is an ongoing process. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, seek help when needed, and enjoy the journey of discovering the power and versatility of Python programming.

#Setting up the Development Environment#

#Setting up a development environment for Python involves installing the necessary tools and libraries to write, test, and run Python code. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up your Python development environment:

#Step 1: Install Python
#- Visit the official Python website at python.org.
#- Go to the Downloads section and choose the appropriate Python version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
#- Download the installer and run it.
#- During the installation process, make sure to check the box that adds Python to the system PATH.

#Step 2: Choose a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
#- Python code is written in plain text files, so you'll need a text editor or an IDE to write and manage your Python code.
#- Some popular choices for text editors are Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Notepad++.
#- IDEs like PyCharm, Spyder, and IDLE provide more advanced features like code debugging and integrated terminal.

#Step 3: Create a Project Directory
#- Choose a location on your computer where you want to keep your Python projects.
#- Create a new folder for your project. This will serve as the project directory.

#Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
#- A virtual environment allows you to create isolated Python environments for different projects, preventing dependency conflicts.
#- Open a command prompt or terminal.
#- Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
#- Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
 # ```
  #python -m venv myenv
 # ```
  #Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.
#- Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:
  #- For Windows:
   # ```
    #myenv\Scripts\activate
   # ```
  #- For macOS/Linux:
   # ```
    #source myenv/bin/activate
   # ```

#Step 5: Install Packages and Libraries
#- Depending on your project requirements, you may need to install additional Python packages and libraries.
#- You can use the package manager called `pip` that comes installed with Python.
#- To install a package, run the following command:
 # ```
  #pip install package_name
 # ```
  #Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install.
#- You can also use a `requirements.txt` file to specify all the required packages for your project and install them in one go:
 # ```
  #pip install -r requirements.txt
 # ```

#Step 6: Write and Run Python Code
#- Open your chosen text editor or IDE and create a new Python file with a `.py` extension.
#- Start writing your Python code in the file.
#- Save the file in your project directory.
#- To run the Python file, open a command prompt or terminal.
#- Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
#- Run the following command to execute the Python file:
 # ```
  #python your_file_name.py
 # ```
  #Replace `your_file_name.py` with the name of your Python file.

#Step 7: Debug and Test Your Code
#- If you're using an IDE like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Spyder, you can take advantage of their built-in debugging tools.
#- Set breakpoints in your code to pause the execution and inspect variables.
#- Use unit testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to write and run tests for your code.

#That's it! You've set up your Python development environment. You can now start writing, testing, and running Python code in an organized and efficient manner. Remember to save your code regularly and commit it to a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others effectively.

#Basic Syntax and Variables

# Basic Syntax and Variables example

# Variable assignment
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True

# Printing variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Is Student:", is_student)

# Mathematical operations
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)

# String concatenation
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + " " + name
print(message)

# User input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome,", user_name)


#Variable Assignment: Variables are assigned values using the '=' operator. In the example, 'name' is assigned the value "John", 'age' is assigned 25, and 'is_student' is assigned True.
#Printing Variables: The 'print()' function is used to display the values of variables. The values are passed as arguments to the 'print()' function. In the example, the values of 'name', 'age', and 'is_student' are printed.
#Mathematical Operations: Variables can be used in mathematical operations. In the example, 'num1' and 'num2' are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#String Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the '+' operator. In the example, the variables 'greeting' and 'name' are concatenated to form the 'message' variable.
#User Input: The 'input()' function is used to prompt the user for input. The value entered by the user is stored in the 'user_name' variable.

#Introduction to OOP Concepts

#Classes and Objects

# Classes and Objects example

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)


# Creating objects from the Rectangle class

rectangle1 = Rectangle(5, 3)
rectangle2 = Rectangle(8, 4)

# Accessing attributes and calling methods on objects

print(f"Rectangle 1: Length = {rectangle1.length}, Width = {rectangle1.width}")
print(f"Area of Rectangle 1: {rectangle1.area()}")
print(f"Perimeter of Rectangle 1: {rectangle1.perimeter()}")

print(f"Rectangle 2: Length = {rectangle2.length}, Width = {rectangle2.width}")
print(f"Area of Rectangle 2: {rectangle2.area()}")
print(f"Perimeter of Rectangle 2: {rectangle2.perimeter()}")


#Class Definition: The 'Rectangle' class is defined with the 'class ClassName:' syntax. It has an '__init__' method, which serves as the constructor and initializes the 'length' and 'width' attributes of the rectangle.

#Object Creation: Objects of the 'Rectangle' class are created using the class name followed by parentheses, passing the required arguments to the constructor. For example, 'rectangle1 = Rectangle(5, 3)' creates a rectangle object with a length of 5 and width of 3.

#Accessing Attributes: The attributes of an object can be accessed using the dot notation. For example, 'rectangle1.length' accesses the 'length' attribute of 'rectangle1'.

#Calling Methods: The methods defined in the class can be called on objects using the dot notation. For example, 'rectangle1.area()' calls the 'area()' method on 'rectangle1' to calculate and return the area of the rectangle.

#Inheritance and Polymorphism

# Inheritance example

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def eat(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is eating.")

    def sleep(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is sleeping.")


class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is barking.")


class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is meowing.")


my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.eat()
my_dog.sleep()
my_dog.bark()

my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
my_cat.eat()
my_cat.sleep()
my_cat.meow()


# Polymorphism example

class Shape:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def area(self):
        pass


class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, side):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side ** 2


class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, radius):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2


my_square = Square("Square", 5)
my_circle = Circle("Circle", 3)

shapes = [my_square, my_circle]

for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area of {shape.name}: {shape.area()}")


#Inheritance: The 'Animal' class is the base class, and the 'Dog' and 'Cat' classes inherit from it using the 'class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):' syntax. The derived classes inherit the attributes and methods of the base class. For example, both 'Dog' and 'Cat' classes inherit the 'eat()' and 'sleep()' methods from the 'Animal' class.

#Polymorphism: The 'Shape' class is an abstract base class (ABC) with the abstract method 'area()'. The 'Square' and 'Circle' classes inherit from 'Shape' and provide their own implementations of the 'area()' method. The code demonstrates polymorphism by creating instances of 'Square' and 'Circle' objects and calling the area() method on each object, which produces the respective area calculation based on the object type.

#Advanced OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction)

# Encapsulation example

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.__mileage = 0  # private attribute

    def drive(self, distance):
        self.__mileage += distance
        print(f"The car has driven {distance} miles.")

    def get_mileage(self):
        return self.__mileage


my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
my_car.drive(50)
my_car.drive(30)
print(f"Mileage: {my_car.get_mileage()}")  # Accessing private attribute through a public method
# print(my_car.__mileage)  # This will raise an AttributeError since __mileage is private


# Abstraction example

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass


class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof"


class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"


class Cow(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Moo"


my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
my_cow = Cow("Daisy")

animals = [my_dog, my_cat, my_cow]

for animal in animals:
    print(f"{animal.name} says {animal.make_sound()}")

#In the above code:

#Encapsulation: The 'Car' class demonstrates encapsulation. The '__mileage' attribute is defined as private by prefixing it with two underscores ('__'). It can only be accessed and modified within the class methods, such as 'drive()' and 'get_mileage()'. Outside the class, it is not directly accessible '(print(my_car.__mileage)' would raise an AttributeError).

#Abstraction: The 'Animal' class is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the abstract method 'make_sound()'. It cannot be instantiated directly. 'The Dog', 'Cat', and 'Cow' classes inherit from 'Animal' and provide their implementations of the 'make_sound()' method. The code demonstrates polymorphism by iterating through a list of animals and calling the 'make_sound()' method, which outputs the respective sound for each animal.
